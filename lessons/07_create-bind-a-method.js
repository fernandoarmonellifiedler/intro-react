Step 7: Create a method
Now that we see how it works with assignments, let's try it with students! We will create an addStudent method to add students the same way we add assignments.

Activity: Create an addStudent method in src/App.jsx

1.On line 37 of src/App.jsx, create a method called addStudent below the comment
    addStudent should take studentName as a parameter
    addStudent should concat studentName to the end of students list that we created earlier
    Hint: You can copy the same format for the addAssignment method
2.Save your changes
3.To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run npm start
4.Exit the process in your terminal using Ctrl + C
5.Stage, commit, and push your changes to the changes branch:

git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "create addStudent method"
git push

---------------------------------------------

Step 8: Binding a method
Since we created a method that changes a state variable, we have to bind it to our class. Then, when we call it, we know what method to reference.

Activity: Bind addStudent to App

1.Uncomment line 18 of src/App.jsx to bind addStudent to App
2.Save your changes
3.To run your code, move inside your repo folder in your terminal and run npm start
4.Exit the process in your terminal using Ctrl + C
5.Stage, commit, and push your changes to the changes branch:

git add src/App.jsx
git commit -m "bind addStudent to App"
git push
